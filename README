rad_eap_test is Nagios compatible shell script used for testing RADIUS
servers by EAP.

Usage is simple (for more info run rad_eap_test withou any argument):

	rad_eap_test -H <radius.server.name> \
		-P 1812 -S <secret> -u <user@realm> \
		-p <password> -m WPA-EAP -e PEAP

as output you might get:

	return code	output
	
	0		access-accept; <latency>
	1		access-reject; <latency>
	2		timeout; <timeout>
	3		sort of config problem


**UPDATE** Patching is no longer needed. All you need is in upstream
version. Following paragraph will be removed in near future.

To run this script you need eapol_test binary from wpa_supplicant
package. It's sugested to use at least 0.5.4. You will need CVS
version 10040 to apply patches/*2006-04-11* which are necesary for
this script. As alternative you can remove:
	-t$TIMEOUT -M$MAC -C"$CONN_INFO"
from calling eapol_test but in this case you will have to wait
30seconds for timeout.

eapol_test is needed compile with LEAP support. In .config should be :

CONFIG_IEEE8021X_EAPOL=y
CONFIG_EAP_MSCHAPV2=y
CONFIG_EAP_TLS=y
CONFIG_EAP_PEAP=y
CONFIG_EAP_TTLS=y
CONFIG_EAP_LEAP=y
CONFIG_IEEE8021X=y

you don't have to compile whole wpa_supplicant you need just
eapol_test. So compile by typing `make eapol_test`. It is not build by
default `make`. ;)

wpa_supplicant home is http://hostap.epitest.fi/wpa_supplicant/
