2009-11-02  Pavel Polacek <pavel.polacek@ujep.cz>
	    * Version: 0.23
	    * Code from David Worth.
	    * added a command-line option (-2 <type>) to change the phase-2
	      authentication type so the user may specify PAP/CHAP/MSCHAPv2.
	      I made sure that if this option is omitted the code still
	      defaults to MSCHAPv2.
	    * added a command-line option (-N) to not delete the generated
	      configuration files and let the user know where they are.
	      This is helpful in debugging or setting up permanent configuration
	      files if you need them. I then changed the garbage function
	      to check the -N option above. I also removed the explicit
	      deletion of the temp files in several places and called
	      the garbage function instead.
